      <description>In this second article on Rplicate Series, We will share to you one way to replicate the plot titled Cherry Bomb from the article &amp;ldquo;Japanâ€™s cherry blossoms are emerging increasingly early, 7th April 2017&amp;rdquo;. The raw dataset used for this graph was obtained from a phenological dataset that was previously collected by Dr. Yasuyuki Aono from Osaka Prefecture University12.
While replicating the plot, we will also learn how to:
 various data pre-processing tricks such as separate a column into several columns, create date data from several columns, and reverse levels of a categorical column create a scatterplot with a custom shape/image as points using geom_smooth() for visualizing trend in the data explore facets and various theme editing on ggplot2  Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in below!</description>

      <description>Geospatial is one of the important things in data processing. With geospatial, we can provide information only with the help of maps so that information can be conveyed properly.
There are many types of geospatial that we can do, such as Dot Map, Connection Map, Choropleth, Hexbin Map, and Bubble Map1. Each type of geospatial has its own function, and each of these types also requires different types of information/data.</description>
