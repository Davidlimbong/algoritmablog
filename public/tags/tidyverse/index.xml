      <description>In this article, I will explain some basic functional programming for fitting multiple time series using R, particularly using purrr interface.
TL;DR: you can find the distraction-free script in here, and read some of my concluding remarks for a quick summary :grin:
PrefaceWhen it comes to time series analyses and forecasting, R users are blessed with an invaluable tools that could helps us to conveniently fit–from basic to advanced–univariate time series models: forecast package.</description>

      <description>Data wrangling sometimes could become very tedious. No matter what language do you prefer: R, python, or even SQL, the process of preprocessing your dataset is generally very time consuming. But, this is not the case if you know how to properly use packages included in tidyverse.
The term of tidyverse is actually referring to a set of packages that you’ll find very helpful in any data analysis tasks; many of them are already popular among R users, like dplyr, ggplot2, and lubridate.</description>

      <description>1. SetupLibraries and SetupWe’ll set-up caching for this notebook given how computationally expensive some of the code we will write can get.
options(scipen = 9999)rm(list=ls())You will need to use install.packages() to install any packages that are not already downloaded onto your machine. You then load the package into your workspace using the library() function:
library(tidyverse)## Warning: package &amp;#39;ggplot2&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.5.3## Warning: package &amp;#39;tibble&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.</description>
